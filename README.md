# 🤖 Instagram Bot

This is a project I created for downloading my files and videos on Instagram automatically, so I simply decided to make a Bot for that

## 🏃‍♂️ How to run

First check if you are in the project's folder

- You gonna need to download a webdriver matching your browser and add it to the drivers the drivers' folder
- Then simply run on your terminal: 

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  chmod +x Instagram.py
  ./Instagram.py
```
